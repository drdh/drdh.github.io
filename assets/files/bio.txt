Heng Dong is an AI researcher at ByteDance Seed in Beijing, working on embodied intelligence and multi-modal foundation models for robotics. His research focuses on building superhuman AI agents by combining interaction-based learning (e.g., reinforcement learning, robot control and design, multi-agent systems) with modern AI models, including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), diffusion models, and flow-based models.

He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Chongjie Zhang and Prof. Yi Wu, under the leadership of Turing Award laureate Prof. Andrew Yao. Prior to that, he earned his B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2020.
