## About Me

I am a researcher at <a href="https://seed.bytedance.com/en/research">ByteDance Research</a> in Beijing, where I work on embodied intelligence and multi-modal foundation models for robotics.

I received my PhD from the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chongjie Zhang](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Chongjie-Zhang.html) and [Prof. Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com). This institute is led by Turing Award laureate [Prof. Andrew Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/).

The goal of my research is to endow agents with superhuman intelligence, which I believe can be achieved through learning from interactions using modern models. My biography is [here](assets/files/bio.txt).
